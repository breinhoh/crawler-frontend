Launch ftserver:

Compile the server with the following command:

gcc ftserver.c -o ftserver

Server cannot be run without specifying port number as second argument. Example use:

./ftserver 30020

Program will output confirmation of launch on specified port number. No further output will be provided until connection is made from a client. Confirmation will be output when directory list or valid file is sent. Perror will output error message if requested file does not exist. Server will run until manually shut down by user with Ctrl+C.

------------------------------

Instructions for chat client:

Python script requires 5 arguments in order to run: host name, host port, action, and receiving port

Example use (list):

python ftclient.py flip.engr.oregonstate.edu 30020 -l 30021

Example use (transfer):

python ftclient.py flip.engr.oregonstate.edu 30020 -g <transferfile> 30021

Server must be running in order for client to function. Client must elect to connect to numbered flip server that the chat server is running on (i.e. flip3) in order for numbered flip selection to work. 

To connect to a numbered flip server, ssh into <username>@access.engr.oregonstate.edu. After you have logged in use this command to connect to the numbered flip server where ftserver is running:

ssh flip<specify number>


Use of -l will output the directory contents of the server directory but will not write to a file. Use of -g on a valid file will result in output confirming connection to server and completion of transfer. Use 'cat filename.txt' in order to confirm contents of transferred file. Use of -g on an invalid file will result in output of error message and no file created.

These files were tested on eos-class, flip1, and flip2.

## Client-Server File Transfer Application

### Server Setup
Connect to the flip server with the following command:
	
	<username>@access.engr.oregonstate.edu

Compile ftserver.c:

	$ gcc ftserver.c -o ftserver

Run the ftserver executable:

	$ ./ftserver <port_number>

#### Example: 
	
	$ ./ftserver 30020

The server is now started on the specified port. 
		 
### File Transfer

The server must be running to enable the client to connect successfully. In a seperate terminal window connect to the flip server with the following command:
	
	<username>@access.engr.oregonstate.edu

After you have logged in, connect to the numbered flip server where ftserver is running:

	ssh flip<specify number>

ftclient.py requires 5 arguments: <host_name> <host_port> <action> <receiving_port>

#### List Example: 

	$ python ftclient.py flip.engr.oregonstate.edu 30020 -l 30021

#### File Transfer Example:

	$ python ftclient.py flip.engr.oregonstate.edu 30020 -g <transfer_file> 30021

Transfers are limited to 4095 characters.

### Testing Machine

This application was tested on flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu and flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu, with success in both cases.
